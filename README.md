# Components Dependency Metrics
## [Apache Eagle](https://github.com/apache/eagle)
From the graph, it can be clearly see that the data are far away from the main sequence line, so it is not well-designed. The abstractness in most of the package is very low and instability are mostly high which mean that the components has less dependents. The suggestion to improve the design and maintainability of the project is to adding more abstract class and make the program be less dependency to the others. This can make the abstractness higher and instability lower.
